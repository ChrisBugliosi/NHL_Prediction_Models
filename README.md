Hello!

Welcome to my project building NHL prediction models for the 2023-24 NHL season via creating a data 
pipeline with individual game data at the team level ranging from a NHL games from the 2008-2024 seasons sourced from 
the NHL API, MoneyPuck, and various other sources.

Predictions were created using various neural networks, XGBoost, logistic regression with ElasticNet regularization, and other 
methods to create win/loss classifiers and single season final standings prediction models that were tested on the 2023-24 NHL season.

I hope you enjoy my project!
