Hello!

Welcome to my project building NHL prediction models for for the 2023-24 NHL season via creating a data 
pipeline with individual game data at the team level ranging from 2008-2024 sourced from the NHL API, MoneyPuck, and various other sources.

Predictions were created using various neural networks, XGBoost, logistic regression with ElasticNet regularization, and other 
models to create win/loss classifiers and single season final standings prediction models that were tested across the 2023-24 NHL season.

I hope you enjoy my project!
